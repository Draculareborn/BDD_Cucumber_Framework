# BDD_Cucumber_Dummy_Framework

## _Introduction_ 
- nopCommerce is an dummy eCommerce shopping website. 
- In the project, we will use a Hybrid Framework built using Maven, Java, Selenium, Gherkin, Cucumber(5.7.0), JUnit, Extent-Report and POM concept .
- In the Login test, we have used @FindBy to store WebElements in the Page Object Model and have created test using Feature and StepDefinition.
- In the Customers test, we have used both @FindBy and By class with findElement(s) in different scenarios, to store WebElements in the Page Object Model and have also used WebDriverWait and have created test using Feature and StepDefinition.
- We have added extent.properties and spark-config.xml by referring to (https://github.com/grasshopper7/extentreports-cucumber5-adapter)

        ```bash
         TestRun.class-> Right Click -> Run As -> JUnit Test.
